<hr />

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>A Christopher Nolan Film about the late american theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer</p>

<h3>Deadpool 3</h3>
<p>Now this movie has not even came out yet but have EXTREME high hopes for to changing the marvel cinematic universe (MCU) with the goat Ryan Reynold and to bring back the one and only HUGH JACKMAN as wolverine! Will be seeing in theaters opening night. (July 2024) Currently is Feb 14th Valentines day and have an update for this movie, we finally seen the trailer for it and offical title is Deadpool and Wolverine.. Trailer is a 10/10 this movie will save the MCU as I said.. ill be waiting Kevin Feige,Hugh, and Ryan Reynolds!!</p>

<h3>Extreme Movie</h3>
<P>A ridiculusly hilarious 2008 movie that is an satirical sex comedy film composed of sketches focusing on teen sex. If i were to make a comedy movie it would definitley be similar to this one</P>

<h3>The Big Bang Theory/Young Sheldon</h3>
<p>A rocker of a sitcom by Chuck Lore and Bill Prady that I should have 1000% watched ages ago about an experimental physicist with an iQ 173 named Sheldon Cooper. This is definitley one of the best TV comedy sitcoms I have seen in my life.
